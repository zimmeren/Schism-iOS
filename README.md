Schism-iOS
==========
iOS portion of mobile app project 

App starting as a social betting app but then pivoted (in order to have a finished app in the alloted timeframe) to a social controversy app where users vote on topics to find the most controversal topics on campus. 

App talks with python backend that is not longer running and also had an Android mobile app too.
